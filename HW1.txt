Excercise 2:
1) Amer Issa -> A is the first letter -> 
int n = 1 -> n/2 = 0.5
round up 0.5
Slide 1 = The Object Oriented Paradigm


Excercise 5:
Explain the following bytecode commands:
•	ILOAD -  Load the int value from local variable at index
•	IINC - increment local variable #index by signed byte const
•	GOTO - goes to another instruction at branchoffset

Assignments, loops, and any other methods you would like to implement in bytecode requires an abundant 
amount of commands in order to perform tasks that would normally take a couple of lines of code in Java. 
You must manually load, push, and store each variable which can be time consuming. You are almost writing 
down each step that the program must go through in order to perform a simple task such as a for loop.

I was able to correlate the methods I would regularly use with Java with the steps that were needed in order
to create the same mehtod within bytecode. It gave me a more in-depth view of how certain methods such as 
for-loops are processed within the program.
